# YCT-529_PBPK_Modeling
This repository contains PK-Sim simulation files, pharmacokinetic data, and Python scripts for analyzing YCT-529, MCC placebo, and Atazanavir. Simulations were run across 16,000 individuals (four doses, four populations) with an additional 1,000 Atazanavir simulations. Includes data preprocessing, visualization, and dose-response analysis.

# **PBPK Model & Data Analysis for YCT-529 Pharmacokinetics**

## **Overview**
This repository contains the **PK-Sim project file (.pksim5)**, Python scripts, and Jupyter Notebook for **physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling and analysis of YCT-529**, a non-hormonal male contraceptive. **PK-Sim** was used to simulate **16,000 pharmacokinetic profiles** across four demographic populations (Black Americans, East Asians, White Americans, and Europeans) and **four dosing regimens** (15 mg, 45 mg, 90 mg, 180 mg). Additionally, Atazanavir was simulated as a reference compound across 1,000 individuals.

Due to **file size limitations**, the dataset is stored externally. You can **download all simulation results from the Google Drive link** below:

## **Repository Contents**
- **`PBPK_data_analysis.ipynb`** â†’ Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- **`pbpk_data_analysis.py`** â†’ Python script version of the analysis notebook.
- **`YCT-529_Simulations.pksim5`** â†’ **PK-Sim project file** containing the full PBPK model (requires PK-Sim to run).

## **Running the Analysis**

### **Option 1: Using the Provided Data**
1. **Download the dataset from the Google Drive link above** and extract it to the same directory as the Python script or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Open **`PBPK_data_analysis.ipynb`** in Jupyter Notebook or **`pbpk_data_analysis.py`** in a Python environment.
3. Run the script to generate figures, dose-response plots, and statistical analyses.

### **Option 2: Running Simulations in PK-Sim**
If you wish to **replicate or modify the PBPK model**, you must install **PK-Sim**:

ðŸ”— **[PK-Sim Installation Guide](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Suite)**  
ðŸ”— **[PK-Sim GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/PK-Sim)**  

1. Download and install **PK-Sim** (Windows/Linux only).
2. Open **`YCT-529_Simulations.pksim5`** in **PK-Sim**.
3. Modify parameters, run new simulations, and export the output CSV files.

### **Practice with Validated Models**
If you're new to **PK-Sim**, consider starting with the **OSP PBPK Model Library**, which contains validated drug models:
