# YCT-529_PBPK_Modeling
This repository contains PK-Sim simulation files, pharmacokinetic data, and Python scripts for analyzing YCT-529, MCC placebo, and Atazanavir. Simulations were run across 16,000 individuals (four doses, four populations) with an additional 1,000 Atazanavir simulations. Includes data preprocessing, visualization, and dose-response analysis.
